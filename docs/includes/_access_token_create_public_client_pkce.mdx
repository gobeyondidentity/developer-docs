In this flow, you call the app's `/authorize` endpoint, initiating a browser based flow where the user provides their credentials in exchange for a code.
In a second API call to the `/token` endpoint, you then exchange the code for an access token.

Note that you will need an identity configured with the [ability to authorize the scopes](/docs/next/api-scopes#scopes-authorized-for-the-identity-approving-the-authorization-request) your app is requesting.

1. Create an [app](/docs/next/add-an-application) with the following properties:

  | Property | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Display Name** | Descriptive name you choose |
  | **Protocol** | OIDC |
  | **Client Type** | Public |
  | **PKCE** | S256 |
  | **Redirect URIs** | Use your application's App Scheme or Universal URL.<br /><br />Your redirect URI follows the pattern:<br /><br /><pre>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity</pre><div class= "note-message note-message-table"><p>`beyondidentity` in this URI is the ID of the OAuth provider as configured in the providers array in NextAuth.js. `/api/auth/callback/` is based on the Next.js route file structure.</p></div> |
  | **Token Endpoint Auth Method** | None |
  | **Grant Type** | Authorization Code |

1. Click the **Authenticator Config** tab

  | Property | Value | 
  | --- | --- |
  | **Configuration Type** | Hosted Web |
  | **Authentication Profile** | Use the recommended values for the remaining options |

1. Click **Submit** to save the new app.

1. Create your `/authorize` request

  Create the HTTP request with the following properties:

  **Request method:** GET

  **Request url:**

  ```http
  https://auth-{us|eu}.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/realms/{realm_id}/applications/{application_id}/authorize?response_type=code&client_id={client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&scope={scopes}&state={state}&code_challenge={codeChallenge}&code_challenge_method=S256
  ```

  where:

  | Property | Value | 
  | --- | --- |
  | **client_id** | {client_id} is your app's **Client ID** |
  | **redirect_uri** | {redirect_uri} is one of the app's configured **Redirect URI** values |
  | **scope** | {scopes} is 'openid' plus one or more of the app's **Allowed Scopes**, space delimited |
  | **state** | {state} is a value generated by your app to maintain state betewen the request and response |
  | **code_challenge** | {codeChallenge} is generated as defined in [RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.2), example JavaScript snippet below:<br/><br/><CodeChallengeVerifier/> |

1. Consume the `/authorize` response and authorization code

  In response to the `/authorize` request, Beyond Identity redirects to the app's configured authentication url.
  In this example, the authenticator configuration type is "Hosted Web", so the authentication url is hosted by Beyond Identity (see [Authenticator Configurations](/docs/next/authentication)).

  :::info important  
  Please note that the redirection must be handled in the front end (such as React, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript running in the user's browser) in order for passkey authentication to work.  
  :::

  Once passkey based authentication is complete, Beyond Identity will redirect back to the app's configued redirect URI with a 'code' parameter in the query string. You will use this code in the `/token` request.

1. Create your `/token` request

  Create the HTTP request with the following properties:

  **Request url:**

  ```http
  https://auth-{us|eu}.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/realms/{realm_id}/applications/{application_id}/token
  ```

  **Request method:** POST

  **Request headers:**

  ```http
  content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  ```

  **Request body:**

  ```http
  grant_type: "authorization_code"
  code: {authorization_code}
  client_id: {client_id}
  redirect_uri: {redirect_uri}
  code_verifier: ${codeVerifier}
  expiration_time: {seconds}
  custom_claims: {custom_claims_json}
  ```

  where:

  | Property | Value | 
  | --- | --- |
  | **code** | {authorization_code} is the code returned from the `/authorize` call |
  | **client_id** | {client_id} is the app's configured **Client ID** |
  | **redirect_uri** | {redirect_uri} is one of the app's configured **Redirect URI** values and matches the redirect_uri sent in the `/authorize` call |
  | **code_verifier** | {codeVerifier} is defined as in [RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636#section-4.1), example JavaScript snippet below:<br/><br/><CodeChallengeVerifier/> |
  | **expiration_time** | expiration_time is an OPTIONAL parameter, and {seconds} is the desired time after minting, in seconds, for which the token will be considered valid. If included, this value must be less than or equal to the app's configured **Expires** setting. |
  | **custom_claims** | custom_claims is an OPTIONAL parameter, and {custom_claims_json} is a JSON string containing the desired additional claims as key value pairs, for example '{"a": "b", "c": "d"}'. Upon successful token request, the resulting token will contain additional field 'bi_custom' with the desired claims. |
