| Value | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| **Automatic** | You want Beyond Identity to do the heavy lifting for you. If you initiate an OAuth2.0 request and specify the "Invoke URL" correctly, we'll get the Beyond Identity authentication URL to where it needs to be, whether this is inside of a native app or a web application. A 302 redirect is returned in response to your app's OIDC request, causing the user agent to automatically redirect to the authentication url.  |
| **Manual** | You want or require a lot more control and flexibity when redirecting to your native/web app. For example:<ul><li>write your own intelligent routing layer using the Beyond Identity authentication URL</li><li>authenticate against passkeys in your browser on desktop, but use passkeys on your native app on mobile</li></ul>The authentication URL is returned to you as part of a JSON response, but it's up to you to get it to your native/web app any way you see fit. <pre class="language-javascript">{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;"authenticate_url": "$invoke_url/bi-authenticate?request=&#060;request&#062;"<br />}</pre>Since the challenge is packaged as part of the URL, it behaves the same as the **Automatic** Invocation Type. |
