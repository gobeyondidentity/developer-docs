:::info Why S256?

PKCE code challenge methods supported for applications, as defined by [RFC-7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636).

<br />

PKCE is enabled for this application, and the server will correlate the `code_challenge` and `code_verifier` between the `authorize` and `token` requests. In this configuration, those fields are required to equate as follows: `code_challenge` = `base64url(sha256(ascii(code_verifier)))`. This is the higher security option and should always be preferred if it is supported by the client.
