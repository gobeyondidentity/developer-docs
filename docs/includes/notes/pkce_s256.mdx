Why S256?

</summary>

Choosing the "S256" PKCE type is strongly recommended for public clients like SPAs or mobile apps. It offers a significant security improvement over the "disabled" and "plain" options, effectively protecting against code interception attacks, which are a major concern in less secure client environments. By using "S256" PKCE, you can ensure a higher level of security for your OAuth 2.0 and OIDC flows and better protect your users' data and resources.
