:::info Why Client Secret Basic?

If your OIDC client is a confidential client and you can securely store the client secret, "client_secret_basic" is the recommended option due to its security benefits and broad support across various authorization servers. However, for public clients or environments where storing the client secret securely is challenging, you might opt for alternative authentication methods like "client_secret_post" or "none," while understanding the trade-offs in security.
