Why Authorization Code?

</summary>

The "authorization_code" grant type is suitable for confidential clients, especially when your application needs to access user-specific resources, requires Single Sign-On (SSO) support, and prioritizes security in the authentication process. It provides a secure and standardized way to obtain access to user data and resources without exposing user credentials to the client application.
