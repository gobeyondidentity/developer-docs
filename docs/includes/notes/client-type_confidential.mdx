:::info Why Confidential?

The confidentiality of the client, as prescribed by OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. Confidentiality is based on a client's ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server (i.e., ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client credentials).

<br />

Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means.
