Use these guidelines to determine the Resource Server settings of your application:

| If your application... | Then... |
| --- | --- |
| References a Resource Server, | The application can include [scopes](/docs/api-scopes) in issued [access tokens](/docs/api-token-overview). The scopes your app can issue are configured in the `allowed_scopes` setting and must be equal to or a subset of the resource server's available scopes. |
| Doesn't reference a Resource Server | The application can only be used to provide authentication (identity) but not authorization (access). Therefore, the scopes element in access tokens will be empty. |
| Doesn't need to provide multiple access levels, like admin vs. user, | Does not necessarily need a resource server. |
| Is for minting tokens for access to the Beyond Identity API | You must set your application's **Resource Server** to **Beyond Identity Management API**. |
