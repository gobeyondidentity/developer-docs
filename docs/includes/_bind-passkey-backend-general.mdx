# Setup your backend

## Get Access Token for API calls

Before making any API calls you'll want to generate an API access token. Check out [API Tokens](/docs/api-token-overview) for help with creating an access token.

## Create an Identity

If the user is creating a new account, you'll want to create an identity with the user's information such as email address and username. Collect this information on your front end and create the identity on your backend. You'll need the `identityId` to bind to a passkey. Check out [Add an identity](/docs/add-an-identity) for help creating an identity.
