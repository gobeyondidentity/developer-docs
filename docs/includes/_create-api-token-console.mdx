2. Select the **API Tokens** tab, and then click on **Create token**. (Note that the **API Tokens** tab only exists for apps that use the client credentials grant type. For apps that use the authorization code grant type, you'll need to [request the token programmatically](/docs/next/create-api-token#api). )
