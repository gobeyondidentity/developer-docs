If you still need to create your Beyond Identity tenant, [sign up with Beyond Identity to create one for free](https://www.beyondidentity.com/developers).  


Now that you have your tenant, log in. You can access the Beyond Identity Admin Console for your tenant at [BI admin console US](https://console-us.beyondidentity.com/login) or [BI admin console EU](https://console-eu.beyondidentity.com/login), depending on the region you chose when you signed up.

_If you're signing in from a different computer or browser, you can enter the email address you used when you signed up. Beyond Identity will send you a one-time link to sign in and enroll a passkey from the new browser._

Next, you'll create a new realm and switch to that realm in your tenant. A realm is just a logical grouping that helps you apply policy later.
