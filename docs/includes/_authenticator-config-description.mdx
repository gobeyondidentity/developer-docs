An Authenticator Config tells us how and where to invoke passkey creation, and authentication flows for your native/mobile or web application. 

Each application is tied to a single **Configuration type**, which is configured on the app's **Authenticator Config** tab.  

Authenticator configuration types are used for both web and native mobile applications:

import AuthenticatorTypeTable from './_authenticator-type-table.mdx';


<AuthenticatorTypeTable />
