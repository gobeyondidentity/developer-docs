With Beyond Identity, you can configure it to add passwordless authentication to your existing authentication solution. 

This guide provides information on how to configure Beyond Identity as an Identity Provider for Okta using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity protocol. 

## Prerequisites

Access to a Beyond Identity tenant. If you still need to, [sign up for a tenant](https://www.beyondidentity.com/developers/signup).


## Create a new realm

Realms are unique administrative domains within a tenant. All new tenants have a default realm called `Beyond Identity Admin` which should not be used to configure for delegate IDP purposes. 

import CreateRealmAdminConsole from '../includes/_create-realm-console.mdx';

<CreateRealmAdminConsole />


## Create an OIDC application

import AddAppAdminConsole  from '../includes/_add-application-console.mdx';

<AddAppAdminConsole />

3. On the **External Protocol** tab, under **Client Configuration**, set the following values:

  | Field | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Protocol** | OIDC |
  | **Client Type** | Confidential |
  | **Grant Type** | Authorization Code |
  | **Redirect URIs** | https://yourokta-domain.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback<br /><br />**Example:**<br />https://yourokta-domain.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback |
  | **Token Endpoint Auth Method** | Client Secret Post |
  | **Resource Server** | None |

4. Scroll down to **Token Configuration** and set the following values and click **Submit**.

  | Field | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Expiration**  |  Set to the desired expiration, for example, `604800`  is one week.  |
  | **Subject**  |  email  |
  | **Token Signing Algorithm**  | RS256   |

5. After the application is created, copy and save the following because you'll need these for the Identity provider configuration in Okta:

   - **Token Endpoint**

   - **Authorization Endpoint**

  ![](../images/okta-integration-token-authentication-endpoints.png) 

6. Go the the realm's dashboard and select **Edit realm**.

7. Copy and save the **Realm Id** and **Tenant ID**. Then click **Cancel**. You'll need these ID's to send the credential binding email.

## Create an API Token 

import CreateApiTokenConsole from '../includes/_create-api-token-console.mdx';
import SendCrendtialBindingEmailCurlCmd from '../includes/_send-a-credential-binding-email-curl-cmd.mdx';

In this step, you'll create an API token for sending a credential binding email to the newly created identity in the new realm. 

<CreateApiTokenConsole />

4. Copy the token to your clipboard.

5. Go back to the second realm that contains the Okta application.

  Now we need to send a credential binding email to the new identity in the second realm. 
  
6. Locate the Authenticator Config ID of the Okta application with the following API call and newly minted bearer token:

  ```bash
  curl --location --request GET 'https://api-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/${tenant_id}/realms/${realm_id}/authenticator-configs' \
  	--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${api_token}'
  ```
7. Using the `authenticator_config_id` from the previous API call, send a credential binding email. The `identity_id` is visible after selecting the identity in the Admin Console. <mark>We don't have a step for copying and saving the `identity_id`.</mark>

  <SendCrendtialBindingEmailCurlCmd />

  An email should be received to bind a credential.

  For more details about the responses to the requests above, see our guide to Sending Enrollment Emails. <p><mark>need a new link since this topic has changed</mark></p>

## Configure the identity provider in Okta

If you do not have a Okta developer account, [sign up for one](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).

Create a user in Okta that you'll use for testing. Ensure the email or username of the test user in Okta matches the identity provisioned in the second realm. 

1. In Okta, select **Security > Identity Providers**.

2. Click **Add Identity Providers**, select **OpenID Connect IdP**, and click **Next**.

3. For Scopes, the only scope needed is **openid**, so you can remove the **profile** and **email** scopes.

4. Paste the Client ID and Client Secret values from the Okta OIDC application you created in the Beyond Identity Admin console. 

  ![](../images/okta-client-id-client-secret.png)

5. In the **Endpoints** section, use the following endpoint values:

  You can find the Authorization and Token endpoints in the Okta OIDC application you created.

  | Name | Value|
  | --- | --- |
  | **Issuer** | https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/${tenant_id}/realms/${realm_id}/applications/${application_id} |
  | **Authorization endpoint** | https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/${tenant_id}/realms/${realm_id}/applications/${application_id}/authorize |
  | **Token endpoint** | https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/${tenant_id}/realms/${realm_id}/applications/${application_id}/token |
  | **JWKS endpoint** | https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/${tenant_id}/realms/${realm_id}/applications/${application_id}/.well-known/jwks.json |

6. In the **Authentication settings** section, select **idpuser.externalId** for **IdP Username**.

7. Select **Okta Username** for **Match against**.  

8. Click the **Routing Rules** tab, click **Add Routing Rule**, and give the rule a name.

9. From the **THEN Use this identity provider** drop-down, select the newly created Identity provider. The rule should match the email attribute of the newly created identity.

10. Click **Create Rule** and at the prompt click **Activate**.

11. Click **Finish** and log out of Okta to test authentication with the newly provisioned identity. 

## Configure Okta to delegate to Beyond Identity

This section describes how to configure Okta to delegate to Beyond Identity for authentication during an OAuth2 authorization flow.
