In this guide, you'll add Beyond Identity <a href="#" data-tooltip="A public and private key pair. The private key is generated and stored and never leaves the user’s devices’ hardware root of trust. The public key, on the other hand, is sent to the Beyond Identity cloud. All keys are cryptographically linked to the user and can be centrally managed using our APIs.">passkeys</a> (public-private key pairs) for user authentication to a [Next](https://nextjs.org) application that uses [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/).

This guide uses Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the [example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example) from [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org). However, you can use these concepts to add Beyond Identity to any web app using your Beyond Identity tenant and OAuth2/OIDC.

:::note  
This guide uses the **Hosted Web** Beyond Identity authenticator type, which has a lighter footprint in your app.
For guidance using the **Embedded SDK** authenticator type, see the **[NextAuth integration guide](/docs/next/next-auth)**.
For more information on authenticator types, check out the article **[here](/docs/next/authentication)**.  
:::

## 1. Sign up for a developer account

import DeveloperSignUpProcess from '../includes/_developer-sign-up-process.mdx';

<DeveloperSignUpProcess />

---

## 2. Clone the sample app

### Download and install the tools

First, make sure you've downloaded and installed the following tools on the development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

You can verify that node, npm and git are installed using the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

### Create the project

1. On the development machine, create a new folder for your project.
2. In VS Code, select **File -> Open Folder** and select your folder
3. In VS Code, open the terminal (**View -> Terminal**)
4. In the VS Code terminal, execute the following commands to use git to clone the example app, change to the app’s directory, and install the app’s dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git
cd next-auth-example
npm install
```

## 3. Configure Beyond Identity

In this step, you'll create a set of Beyond Identity resources containing your end users' identities and the configuration. First, you'll create a new realm, which holds your users' identities. Next, you'll create a new application that contains the configuration for your users.

### Create your Beyond Identity initial configuration

1. If you haven't already created your Beyond Identity tenant, create one for free [here](https://www.beyondidentity.com/developers/signup).
2. Once you have your tenant, go ahead and log in . You can access the Beyond Identity admin console for your tenant at [BI admin console US](https://console-us.beyondidentity.com/login) or [BI admin console EU](https://console-eu.beyondidentity.com/login), depending on the region you chose when you signed up.  
   :::tip  
   _If you are signing in from a different computer or browser, you can enter the email address you used when you signed up. Beyond Identity will send you a one time link you can use to sign in and enroll a passkey from the new browser._  
   :::

Next, you will [create a new realm and switch to that realm](/docs/next/get-started-nextjs#create-a-new-realm) in your tenant. A realm is just a logical grouping that helps you apply policy later.

### Create a new realm

So far, you have the Beyond Identity Admin Realm for your Beyond Identity tenant only. In this step, you'll create a new Realm to hold your users' identities.

import CreateRealmConsole from '../includes/_create-realm-console.mdx';

<CreateRealmConsole />

Next, you will [create an app in the realm](/docs/next/get-started-nextjs#create-an-application) using the configuration options in the next section.

### Create an application

In this step, you'll create a new Application that will contain the configuration for your users.

import AddAppAdminConsole from '../includes/_add-application-console.mdx';

<AddAppAdminConsole />

Configure the [app](/docs/next/add-an-application) with the following properties:

| Parameter                                                | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

<br />

Click **Submit** to save the app.

### Complete the configuration

#### Record your Beyond Identity configuration

In this step, you'll collect the configuration elements you will need to set environment variables in the sample app's '.env.config' table.

The table below lists these elements and where to find them in the tenant.

| Property Name                 | Where to find the value                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID     | Copy your app’s **Client ID** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant          |
| BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET | Copy your app’s **Client Secret** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant      |
| BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY     | Copy your app’s **Discovery Endpoint** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |

Next, you will [configure the sample app in your VS Code project](/docs/next/get-started-nextjs#4-set-environment-variables-and-configure-beyond-identity-as-an-oauth-provider-in-the-sample-app) to setup environment variables and an OAuth provider for Beyond Identity.

---

:::tip **CHECKPOINT**

Guess what? You're halfway there! So far in your getting started journey, you should have completed the following:

- [x] Signed up for a free Beyond Identity developer account, which created a passkey, tenant, and Admin Realm for you automatically.

- [x] Cloned the example application.

- [x] Created the initial configuration in your tenant, including a realm and an application.

<br />
In the next step, you'll setup the example application locally:  

- Create and populate .env.local file

- Create Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider in the app

- Create identities and run the app
  <br />  

Don't forget, if you get stuck, let us know in our **[Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/byndid/shared_invite/zt-1anns8n83-NQX4JvW7coi9dksADxgeBQ)**.

## 4. Set environment variables and configure Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider in the sample app

### Environment variables and .env.local file

Make the following changes to your NextAuth example app project to setup your environment variables:

1. Make a copy of the file **.env.local.example** called **.env.local**

2. In .env.local, configure the following variables from your Beyond Identity tenant:

| Variable Name                 | Where to find the value                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NEXTAUTH_URL                  | Use the default value of http://localhost:3000                                                                           |
| NEXTAUTH_SECRET               | generate one here: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32                                                                 |
| BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID     | Copy your app’s **Client ID** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant          |
| BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET | Copy your app’s **Client Secret** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant      |
| BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY     | Copy your app’s **Discovery Endpoint** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |

Copy and paste the value from **Applications > {New Application} > External Protocol > Issuer**.
Your **.env.local** file's contents should look something like the example below:

```javascript
# Next Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=df118e1458e3490b22dc8e2d2a6f0247
...

# Beyond Identity
BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=Njlb6brHbCofRyCWGkiUQweTz
BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=zs2oENddYNes ... 7uamRhvRJ9d3ZJcI97X
BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY=https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/000111222333/realms/444555666777888/applications/1233449b-11c4-4884-b622-0bfbaefd44d3
```

3. Update the contents of the file **process.d.ts** to the following:

```javascript
declare namespace NodeJS {
  export interface ProcessEnv {
    NEXTAUTH_URL: string
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET: string
    BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID: string
    BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET: string
    BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY: string
  }
}
```

### Create OAuth provider

Make the following change to your NextAuth example app project to configure Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider:

If you are using NextJS Version 12, create a route at **pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js**.  
If you are using NextJS Version 13, create a route at **app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts**.

Inside the `providers` array, add the following entry:

```javascript
{
    id: "beyondidentity",
    name: "Beyond Identity",
    type: "oauth",
    wellKnown: process.env.BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY,
    authorization: { params: { scope: "openid" } },
    clientId: process.env.BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET,
    idToken: true,
    checks: ["pkce", "state"],
    profile(profile) {
    return {
        id: profile.sub,
        name: profile.sub,
        email: profile.sub,
    }
    },
},
```

:::note  
 [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) is becoming [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev), and Beyond Identity will be a built-in provider. Updated guidance is coming soon! In the meantime, use the guidance above.  
:::

### Double check the package.json file

Inside the **package.json** file, ensure that the scripts that run the app use the correct port that is used in the following URLs:

- your NEXTAUTH_URL, such as 'http://localhost:3000'
- the app's configured redirect URI in the BI tenant, such as 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity'

Next's default port is 3000, so you do not need to specify a port if you are using port 3000.

:::note  
If you are using a different port in your NEXTAUTH_URL, for example '8083', the app's redirect URI would be specified as http://localhost:8083/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity, and the script should start the app using the -p option, for example `"next -p 8083"`  
:::

Next, you will [create users and passkeys](#create-users-and-passkeys) so that you can test the app.

## 5. Create users and passkeys

Because you created an app with the 'Hosted Web' authentication configuration type, you are ready to test without writing any more code. The 'Hosted Web' authentication configuration handles user registration as well as authentication. If you would like more customization, you might consider using the 'Embedded SDK' configuration type. For more information see the **[NextAuth integration guide](/docs/next/next-auth)**.

## 6. Run the example application and test sign in

In this step, you'll start the backend and frontend to run the example app locally.

In VS Code, execute `npm run dev` at the terminal prompt. From the browser where you created the passkey above, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. Here you should be able to click Sign in and sign in to the app as shown below.
