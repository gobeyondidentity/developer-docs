In this guide, you'll add Beyond Identity <a href= "#" data-tooltip= "A public and private key pair. The private key is generated and stored and never leaves the user's devices' hardware root of trust. The public key, on the other hand, is sent to the Beyond Identity cloud. All keys are cryptographically linked to the user and can be centrally managed using our APIs.">passkeys</a> (public-private key pairs) for user authentication to a [Next](https://nextjs.org) application that uses [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/).

This guide uses Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the [example app](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example) from [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org). However, you can use these concepts to add Beyond Identity to any web app using your Beyond Identity tenant and OAuth2/OIDC.

:::note  
This guide uses the **Hosted Web** Beyond Identity authenticator type, which has a lighter footprint in your app.
For guidance using the **Embedded SDK** authenticator type, see the **[NextAuth integration guide](/docs/next/next-auth)**.
See the **[Authentication](/docs/next/authentication)** article for more information on authenticator types.  
:::

## 1. Sign up for a developer account

import DeveloperSignUpProcess from '../includes/_developer-sign-up-process.mdx';

<DeveloperSignUpProcess />

---

## 2. Clone the sample app

### Download and install the tools

First, make sure you've downloaded and installed the following tools on the development machine:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

You can verify that node, npm, and git are installed using the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
git --version
```

### Create the project

1. On the development machine, create a new folder for your project.

2. In VS Code, select **File > Open Folder** and select your project folder.

3. Open the terminal (**View > Terminal**) and clone the example app, change to the app's directory, and install the app's dependencies.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth-example.git
  cd next-auth-example
  npm install
  ```

## 3. Configure Beyond Identity

In this step, you'll create a set of Beyond Identity resources containing your end users' identities and the configuration. First, you'll create a new realm that holds your users' identities. Next, you'll create a new application containing your users' configuration.

:::tip  
_If you are signing in from a different computer or browser, you can enter the email address you used when you signed up. Beyond Identity will send you a one-time link to sign in and enroll a passkey from the new browser._  
:::

### Create a new realm

So far, you have the Beyond Identity Admin Realm for your Beyond Identity tenant only. In this step, you'll create a new Realm to hold your users' identities.

import CreateRealmConsole from '../includes/_create-realm-console.mdx';

<CreateRealmConsole />

### Create an application

In this step, you'll create a new Application containing the configuration for your users.

import AddAppAdminConsole from '../includes/_add-application-console.mdx';

<AddAppAdminConsole />

3. On the **External Protocol** tab, use the following values to complete this tab.

  | Property | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Display Name** | Descriptive name you choose |
  | **Protocol** | OIDC<br /><ProtocolOIDC/> |
  | **Client Type** | Confidential<br /><ClientTypeConfidential/> |
  | **PKCE** | S256<br /><PKCES256/> |
  | **Redirect URIs** | Use your application's App Scheme or Universal URL.<br /><br />Your redirect URI follows the pattern:<br /><br /><pre>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity</pre><div class= "note-message note-message-table"><p>`beyondidentity` in this URI is the ID of the OAuth provider as configured in the providers array in NextAuth.js. `/api/auth/callback/` is based on the Next.js route file structure.</p></div> |
  | **Token Endpoint Auth Method** | Client Secret Basic<br /><TokenEndpointAuthMethodClientSecretBasic/> |
  | **Grant Type** | Authorization Code<br /><GrantTypeAuthorizationCode/> |
  | **All other options** | Use the default values for the remaining options |

4. Click the **Authenticator Config** tab
  
  | Property | Value | 
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | **Configuration Type** | Hosted Web <br /><HostedWeb/> |
  | **Authentication Profile** | Use the recommended values for the remaining options |

5. Click **Submit** to save the new app.

### Complete the configuration

In this step, you'll collect the configuration elements you must set environment variables in the sample app's `.env.config` table.

The table below lists these elements and where to find them in the tenant.

| Property Name | Where to find the value |
| --- | --- |
| **`BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`** | Copy your app’s **Client ID** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |
| **`BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`** | Copy your app’s **Client Secret** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |
| **`BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY`** | Copy your app’s **Discovery Endpoint** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |

---

:::tip **CHECKPOINT**

Guess what? You're halfway there! So far in your getting started journey, you should have completed the following:

- [x] Signed up for a free Beyond Identity developer account, which created a passkey, tenant, and Admin Realm for you automatically.

- [x] Cloned the example application.

- [x] Created the initial configuration in your tenant, including a realm and an application.

<br />
In the next step, you'll set up the example application locally:

- Create and populate .env.local file

- Create Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider in the app

- Create identities and run the app
<br />

## 4. Configure Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider

In this step, set your environment variables and configure Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider in the sample app.

### Environment variables and .env.local file

Make the following changes to your NextAuth example app project to set up your environment variables:

1. Make a copy of the file **.env.local.example** called **.env.local**

2. In .env.local, configure the following variables from your Beyond Identity tenant:

  | Variable Name | Where to find the value |
  | --- | --- |
  | **`NEXTAUTH_URL`** | Use the default value of http://localhost:3000 |
  | **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`** | generate one here: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 |
  | **`BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`** | Copy your app’s **Client ID** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |
  | **`BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET`** | Copy your app’s **Client Secret** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |
  | **`BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY`** | Copy your app’s **Discovery Endpoint** from the **External Protocol** tab on the app’s configuration page in your tenant |

1. Copy and paste the value from **Applications > \{New Application\} > External Protocol > Issuer**.

  Your **.env.local** file's contents should look something like the example below:

  ```javascript title=".env.local"
  # Next Auth
  NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
  NEXTAUTH_SECRET=df118e1458e3490b22dc8e2d2a6f0247
  ...

  # Beyond Identity
  BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=Njlb6brHbCofRyCWGkiUQweTz
  BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET=zs2oENddYNes ... 7uamRhvRJ9d3ZJcI97X
  BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY=https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/000111222333/realms/444555666777888/applications/1233449b-11c4-4884-b622-0bfbaefd44d3
  ```

3. Update the contents of the file **process.d.ts** to the following:

  ```javascript
  declare namespace NodeJS {
    export interface ProcessEnv {
      NEXTAUTH_URL: string
      NEXTAUTH_SECRET: string
      BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID: string
      BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET: string
      BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY: string
    }
  }
  ```

### Create OAuth provider

Make the following change to your NextAuth example app project to configure Beyond Identity as an OAuth provider:

| Next.js Version | Route |
| --- | --- |
| **12** | Create a route at **pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js**. |
| **13** | Create a route at **app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts**. |

Inside the `providers` array, add the following entry:

```javascript
{
    id: "beyondidentity",
    name: "Beyond Identity",
    type: "oauth",
    wellKnown: process.env.BEYOND_IDENTITY_DISCOVERY,
    authorization: { params: { scope: "openid" } },
    clientId: process.env.BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.BEYOND_IDENTITY_CLIENT_SECRET,
    idToken: true,
    checks: ["pkce", "state"],
    profile(profile) {
      return {
        id: profile.sub,
        name: profile.sub,
        email: profile.sub,
      }
    },
},
```

:::note  
 [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) is becoming [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev), and Beyond Identity will be a built-in provider. The updated guidance is coming soon! In the meantime, use the guidance above.  
:::

### Double-check the package.json file

Inside the **package.json** file, ensure that the scripts that run the app use the correct port for the following URLs:

- your NEXTAUTH_URL, such as 'http://localhost:3000'
- the app's configured redirect URI in the BI tenant, such as 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity'

Next's default port is 3000, so you do not need to specify a port if you use port 3000.

:::note  
If you are using a different port in your NEXTAUTH_URL, for example, '8083', the app's redirect URI would be http://localhost:8083/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity, and the script should start the app using the -p option, for example `"next -p 8083" `
:::

Next, you'll [create users and passkeys](#create-users-and-passkeys) test the app.

## 5. Create users and passkeys

You are ready to test without writing more code because you created an app with the 'Hosted Web' authentication configuration type. The 'Hosted Web' authentication configuration handles user registration and authentication. If you want more customization, consider using the 'Embedded SDK' configuration type. For more information, see the **[NextAuth integration guide](/docs/next/next-auth)**.

## 6. Run the example application and test sign in

In this step, you'll start the backend and frontend to run the example app locally.

1. In VS Code, run:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

2. From the browser where you created the passkey above, navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Sign in to the app, as shown below.

  Registration and passkey binding happens in the Hosted Web UI. The user gets prompted to provide an email for verification on the first authentication. They'll have the option to generate a passkey on trusted devices, which they'll use on this device each time they authenticate.
