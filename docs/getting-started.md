In this guide we will show you how to create and configure your account and connect a demo application to it. This app will demonstrate common workflows like creating a passkey and using it to authenticate.

# Start by cloning the example app (for developers)

If you're not a developer or don't want to download the code yet, you can use the Try It Out ðŸš€ experience: [Try it out](/docs/v1/try-it-out) ðŸš€ 

## 1. Check the basics

The Beyond Identity Example Application is made up of a [node.js](https://nodejs.org) backend and a [NextJS](https://next-auth.js.org/) frontend. You'll need standard developer tools to get it up and running.

#### **macOS, Windows and Linux**

1. **Git:** Download and install `git`: https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. **NodeJS**: Download and install `nodejs`: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. **Yarn**: Download and install `yarn`: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

---

## 2. Download the example application

### Clone the repo

The source code for the example application is hosted in [Github](https://github.com/gobeyondidentity/getting-started).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gobeyondidentity/getting-started.git
```

Change directory into the repo:

```bash
cd getting-started
```

---

## 3. Create a Tenant

Head to the [signup form](https://www.beyondidentity.com/developers/signup) and fill out your info.

If you've already created a tenant, you can log in using the following links:

- [Admin Console - US Region](https://console-us.beyondidentity.com/login)
- [Admin Console - EU Region](https://console-eu.beyondidentity.com/login)

> This process creates various resources described in Beyond Identity's [architecture](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/docs/v1/platform-overview/architecture). It also creates a [passkey](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/docs/v1/platform-overview/passkeys-and-devices/what-are-passkeys) that allows you to log into the Beyond Identity Console without a password. Due to the nature of passkeys, the credential created on signup _only works with the Console_. New passkeys must be created in the correct realm for accessing other applications. To learn more about what happens behind the scenes when you sign up for a developer account, see [Account Setup](./workflows/account-setup.md).

Once your tenant has been created with Beyond Identity, you can continue to configure the sample app, get an API token, a `tenant_id`, a `realm_id` and some other configuration parameters.

---

## 4. Make a copy of the config file

Run the following command from the home directory for the example app:

```mac tab
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

```win tab
copy .env.local.example .env.local
```

---

## 5. Set your Region variable on the config file

Edit `.env.local` and set the value of the `REGION` variable according to where your account was created (`us` or `eu`).

---

## 6. Get your Tenant ID

<Arcade clip={Clip.FindTenantID} />

Log into the [Admin Console](https://console-us.beyondidentity.com), then to get your Tenant ID:

1. On the navigation bar to the left click **Home**.

2. Click **Edit Realm** on the top right side of your screen, copy the `Tenant ID` value.

3. Edit `.env.local` and paste the value of the `TENANT_ID` variable from the clipboard.

---

## 7. Create an API token

<Arcade clip={Clip.CreateAPIToken} />

From the [Admin Console](https://console-us.beyondidentity.com), create an API Token for your tenant by:

1. Click **Applications**.
2. Click **Beyond Identity Management API**.
3. Click **API Tokens**.
4. **Create a token and click the copy button**, use the API Token to set the environment variables as shown below.
5. Edit `.env.local` and paste the value of the `API_TOKEN` variable from the clipboard.

---

## 8. Configure Beyond Identity to manage identities for your app

So far, only the [Admin Realm](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/docs/v1/platform-overview/architecture#admin-realm) exists for your Beyond Identity tenant. You don't want your app's users to be created there! The steps below create a set of Beyond Identity resources that will contain your end users' identities.

### Create a Realm

We need to create a new [Realm](./workflows/realms.md) to hold identities and configuration:

<Arcade clip={Clip.CreateRealm} />

From the Admin Console:

1. Click the Realm selector on the top-left.
2. Click **Create New Realm**.
3. Type the name of your new realm. Click **Create Realm**.
4. Click **Switch to Realm**.
5. From the Realm's Home page, click Edit.
6. **Copy the value for Realm ID** and paste it on the `.env.local` file under `REALM_ID`.

### Create an Application

Next, we we'll create a new [Application](./workflows/applications.md) that contains the configuration for your end users:

<Arcade clip={Clip.CreateApplication} />

From the Admin Console:

1. From the navigation bar, click **Apps**, then click **Add app**.
2. Type a name for your new Application.
3. Scroll to Redirect URIs, type `http://localhost:8083/api/auth/callback/beyondidentity`
4. Ensure "Token Endpoint Auth Method" is set to "Client Secret Basic".
5. Click on the Authenticator Config tab, change the Configuration Type to `Embedded` and set the **Invoke URL** and **Trusted Origin** values to: `http://localhost:8083`
6. Click Submit to save your changes.

### Complete your example application's configuration

Next, we'll copy the **Application ID**, **Authenticator Configuration ID**, **App Client ID** and **App Secrets** into the `.env.local` configuration.

<Arcade clip={Clip.CopyClientIDClientSecretAndApplicationID} />

From the Admin Console:

1. From the navigation bar, click **Applications**, then select the application created on the step above.
2. **Copy the value for Application ID** and paste it on the `.env.local` file under `APPLICATION_ID`.
3. **Copy the value for Client ID** and paste it on the `.env.local` file under `APP_CLIENT_ID`.
4. **Copy the value for Client Secret** and paste it on the `.env.local` file under `APP_CLIENT_SECRET`.

<Arcade clip={Clip.CopyAuthenticatorConfigID} />

Next, copy the Authenticator Config ID into the config file:

5. Click on the Authenticator Config tab, **Copy the value for Authenticator Config ID** and paste it on the `.env.local` file under `AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIG_ID`.

Learn more about [Authenticator Configurations](/docs/v1/platform-overview/authenticator-config).

## 9. Running the example application

The example application uses the Beyond Identity Embedded [JavaScript SDK](./workflows/sdk-setup?sdks=javascript).

### Start the backend and frontend

Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

and run with:

```
yarn start
```

A new browser tab should open automatically. If it doesn't, open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083). The example application will now appear and allow you to create passkeys in the browser.

<Arcade clip={Clip.GettingStartedDemoApp} />

You can also see this example in action by visiting: [https://acme.beyondidentity.com/](https://acme.beyondidentity.com/)

---

## What's next?

You can use the example application above to create one or more passkeys and log in with them.

Check out workflow guides for more detailed information starting with [Account Setup](./workflows/account-setup.md).
