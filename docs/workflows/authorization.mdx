## Client Credentials flow




## Authorization Code flow


The authorization code flow is a two-part process: 

- An authorization grant code must be obtained and received through your callback specified in the `redirect_uri`. Your `state` and PKCE should be validated when extracting the code. 
- The grant code must be used to create an access token.
