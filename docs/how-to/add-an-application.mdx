<AppDescription />

  

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have a developer account, which comes with the **Beyond Identity Admin Realm** and **Beyond Identity Management API** app.

## Admin Console

An application can be created from the Beyond Identity Admin Console.

:::tip

Most of the time you will want to create a new application in a different realm other than your Beyond Identity Admin Realm. Applications created in the Beyond Identity Admin Realm default to the Client Credentials grant which is used for applications requesting access outside of the context of a user. Applications created in another realm default to the Authorization Code grant which is used by users requesting access. If you need guidance, visit **[Create a realm](/docs/next/create-realm)**.

import AddAppAdminConsole  from '../includes/_add-application-console.mdx';

### External Protocol Tab
#### Client Configuration
Configure your application's basic settings. After saving, the values entered will be used to generate OIDC configuration endpoints for your application as well as your Client ID and Client Secret.

  | Setting | What you can do |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Protocol**   |  <mark>Why choose one over the other?</mark>For examples of how to use OAuth and OIDC flows to request tokens, see [request api tokens](/docs/next/create-api-token#token-request-scenarios)<ul><li><b>OAuth2</b>: With the OAuth2 protocol, you can use either the client credentials grant type or the authorization code grant type.</li><li><b>OIDC</b>: With the OIDC protocol, you must use the authorization code grant type. With OIDC, you can obtain an id_token as well as an access_token. </li></ul>  | 
  |  **Client Type**  |  <ul><li><b>Confidential</b>: clients are applications that are able to securely authenticate with the authorization server, for example being able to keep their registered client secret safe. Think of an application with a backend.</li><li><b>Public</b>: clients are unable to use registered client secrets, such as applications running in a browser or on a mobile device. You will not receive an application "Client Secret" if you create this type of application. </li></ul>   |
  |  **PKCE**  | If PKCE is set to **Disabled**, you do not need to send the PKCE parameters (code_challenge, code_challenge_method, and code_verifier) in your token requests. However, authorization code grant with PKCE is the recommended flow for token requests and is required for public clients. |  
  |  **Redirect URIs**  |  A list of valid URIs to redirect the resource owner's user-agent to after completing its interaction with the authorization server. See [Section 3.1.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2) for more information.   |
  |  **Token Endpoint Auth Method**  |  <ul><li><b>Client Secret Basic</b>: The client uses HTTP Basic as defined in OAuth 2.0, [Section 2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.3.1). The client ID and client secret are sent in the Basic Authorization header.</li><li><b>Client Secret Post</b>: The client uses the HTTP POST parameters as defined in OAuth 2.0, [Section 2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.3.1). The client ID and client secret are sent in the body of the POST request.</li></ul>   |
  |  **Grant Type**  |  <ul><li><b>Authorization Code</b>: The authorization code grant type defined in OAuth 2.0, [Section 4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1). Namely, the client may authorize to the token endpoint with a grant code which it obtains via the authorize endpoint.</li><li><b>Client Credentials</b>: The client credentials grant type defined in OAuth 2.0, [Section 4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.4). Namely, the client may authorize to the token endpoint with a client credentials tuple of client_id and client_secret. If you select **Client Credentials**, the application cannot have an associated authenticator configuration.</li></ul>   |
  |  **Resource Server**  |  If the app is linked to a resource server, the resource server determines the [scopes the app can be allowed](/docs/next/api-scopes) to issue.   |
  |  **Token Format**  |  The two options for token format are **Self-Contained** and **Referential**. The difference between these two options impacts how the tokens will be validated. **Self-Contained** tokens can be validated offline because they contain all of the validation information. **Referential** tokens require a call to an introspection API for validation.  |
 

#### Token Configuration
| Setting | What you can do |
| --- | --- |  
| Allowed Scopes | If the app is configured with a Resource Server, then this setting specifies the scopes allowed to be included in tokens for this application. The allowed scopes can match or be a subset of the Resource Server scopes |  
| Expires | Token lifetime in seconds |  
| Subject | Property of a principal which is used to fill the subject of a token issued for this application. |  
| Token Signing Algorithm | Signing algorithm to use for an application token. The only allowable value at present is RS256. |  

#### Refresh Token Configuration
| Setting | What you can do |
| --- | --- |  
| **Enable Refresh Tokens** | When enabled, the token response JSON object will contain an additional field called `refresh_token`, similar to [RFC6749#4.1.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4). |  

### Authenticator Config Tab
Select the [authenticator configuration type](/docs/next/authentication).

  <Tabs groupId="authenticator-config">
    <TabItem value="hosted-web" label="Hosted Web">
      <p>Select the <b>Hosted Web</b> option if you want Beyond Identity to do the heavy lifting. This option requires less configuration and code because Beyond Identity handles the end-user authentication via a redirect. </p><br /><p>Hosted Web Authenticator comes preconfigured with the following values:</p><ul><li><b>Invocation Type</b>: automatic </li><li><b>Invoke URL</b>: https://auth-&#123;REGION&#125;.beyondidentity.com/authenticator/</li><li><b>Trusted Origin</b>: [https://auth-&#123;REGION&#125;.beyondidentity.com/authenticator/]</li></ul>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="embedded" label="Embedded SDK">
    <p>Select the <b>Embedded SDK</b> option if you want to custom-build your end-user authentication experience. This option requires more configuration and code:</p>
    <div class="tabs-list">
    <ol><li>Set an <b>Invocation Type</b> to specify how an authentication URL is delivered to your application.<p><InvocationTypeTable /></p></li><li>Set an <b>Invoke URL</b> that "points" to where your application is. In the case of a native application (iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native), this is either an App Scheme or an Universal URL / App Link. In the case of a web application, this is just a URL to your web application or a specific page of your web application.<p><AppSchemeCaution/></p></li><li>Set <b>Trusted Origins</b> with your website's URL to add it to a whitelist. By default, cross origin requests are blocked by our server.</li></ol>
    </div>
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>



Click **Submit**. You'll be taken to the app page for the new application. Here, you'll be able to a number of things, such as edit the basic and advanced settings or configure the signup/login experience. 


## API

Before creating an application by API, you must have an [API access token](/docs/next/create-api-token#api). You'll also need to create a Resource Server and an Authenticator Config, which you'll do below. A Resource Server is a namespace for application scopes that are a set of all scopes supported by the application. An Authenticator Config defines the invocation type, invoke URL, and trusted origins. 

1. Create a [Resource Server](/docs/next/add-resource-server#api). A Resource Server is a namespace for application scopes that are a set of all scopes supported by the application. 

  <ResourceServerDescription />

  <MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl "https://api-$(REGION).beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/$(TENANT_ID)/realms/$(REALM_ID)/resource-servers" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(TOKEN)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"resource_server\":{\"display_name\":\"$(APPLICATION_DISPLAY_NAME)\",\"identifier\":\"$(APPLICATION_URI)\",\"scopes\":[\"$(SCOPE)\"]}}"'
  title="/resource-servers"
  />

2. Create an Authenticator Config and make a note of the Authenticator Config ID. 

  Follow these guidelines to determine if your use case requires the Authenticator Config ID for creating your application:

  | Protocol | Grant Type | Required? |
  | --- | --- | --- | 
  | OAuth | Client Credentials |  No  |
  | OAuth | Authorization Code |  Yes  |

  You'll set the application's Configuration Type, Invocation Type, Invoke URL, and Trusted Origins. 

  <MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl "https://api-$(REGION).beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/$(TENANT_ID)/realms/$(REALM_ID)/authenticator-config" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(TOKEN)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"authenticator_config\":{\"config\":{\"type\":\"$(CONFIGURATION_TYPE)\",\"invoke_url\":\"$(INVOKE_URL)\",\"trusted_origins\":[\"$(TRUSTED_ORIGIN)\"],\"invocation_type\":\"$(INVOCATION_TYPE)\"}}}"'
  title="/authenticator-config"
  />

3. Create an application using at least the Authenticator Config ID, specifically if your application's `grant_type` is set to **authorization_code**. The Resource Server ID is optional. 

  You'll set the application's Display Name, Client Type (confidentiality), Token Configuration, and one ore more redirect URIs. 

  There are two options available for `confidentiality`:

  | Option | What to do |
  | --- | --- |
  |  **confidential**  |  set the `token_endpoint_auth_method` to  one of the following:<ul><li>**client_secret_post**</li><li>**client_secret_basic**</li></ul>   |
  |  **public**  |  set the `token_endpoint_auth_method` to **none**   |

  <MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl "https://api-$(REGION).beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/$(TENANT_ID)/realms/$(REALM_ID)/applications" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(TOKEN)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"application\":{\"display_name\":\"$(DISPLAY_NAME)\",\"resource_server_id\":\"$(RESOURCE_SERVER_ID)\",\"authenticator_config_id\":\"$(AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIG_ID)\",\"protocol_config\":{\"type\":\"oidc\",\"allowed_scopes\": [\"$(SCOPE)\"],\"confidentiality\": \"$(CLIENT_TYPE)\",\"token_endpoint_auth_method\":\"$(TOKEN_ENDPOINT_AUTH_METHOD)\",\"grant_type\": [\"authorization_code\"],\"redirect_uris\": [\"$(REDIRECT_URI)\"],\"token_configuration\":{\"subject_field\":\"$(TOKEN_SUBJECT_FIELD)\",\"expires_after\":86400,\"token_signing_algorithm\":\"RS256\"},\"pkce\":\"s256\", \"token_format\": \"self_contained\"}}}"'
  title="/applications"
  />

  Token configuration, such as expiration and default allowed scopes, can be modified either through the Beyond Identity Admin Console or through API on [application update](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Applications/operation/UpdateApplication).
