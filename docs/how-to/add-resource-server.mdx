A Resource Server is a namespace for application scopes that are a set of all scopes supported by the application.  

<ResourceServerDescription />

## Admin Console
A resource server can be created from the Beyond Identity Admin Console. 
1. First, click **Go to realm** and select the realm in which you wish to create the resource server. This should be the realm of the application that you wish to link to the resource server.  
2. Under **Authorization**, select **Resource Servers**.  
3. Click **Create resource server**.  
4. Fill in the Create resource server screen as follows:
 - Enter a **Resource Server Name**. This can be any human readable string.  
 - Enter a **Resource Server Identifier**. This identifier will be included as the audience claim in access tokens minted for an application that issues scopes owned by this resource server. 
 - Enter one or more **Scopes** (press **Enter** or **Return** after each scope).  These scopes will be eligible to be configured as **Allowed Scopes* for applications that you link to this resource server.  
 For more information these parameters, see the [API documentation for creating a resource server](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Resource-Servers/operation/CreateResourceServer).  
 5. Finally click **Create resource server** to complete creating the resource server.  


## API
Before creating a resource server by API, you must have an [API access token for the Beyond Identity Management API](/docs/next/create-api-token#example-create-a-token-for-the-beyond-identity-management-api) that contains the scope 'resource-servers:create'.  


To create a resource server, use the [create resource server API](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Resource-Servers/operation/CreateResourceServer).  

  <MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl "https://api-$(REGION).beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/$(TENANT_ID)/realms/$(REALM_ID)/resource-servers" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(TOKEN)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"resource_server\":{\"display_name\":\"$(APPLICATION_DISPLAY_NAME)\",\"identifier\":\"$(APPLICATION_URI)\",\"scopes\":[\"$(SCOPE)\"]}}"'
  title="/resource-servers"
  />  

where:  
 - TOKEN is a base64 encoded [API access token for the Beyond Identity Management API](/docs/next/create-api-token#example-create-a-token-for-the-beyond-identity-management-api) that contains the scope 'resource-servers:create'  
 - APPLICATION_DISPLAY_NAME is any human readable string  
 - APPLICATION_URI is a unique string will be included as the audience claim in access tokens minted for an application that issues scopes owned by this resource server (for more information see the [API documentation](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Resource-Servers/operation/CreateResourceServer))  
 - SCOPE is a list of scopes this resource server will be eligible to include in tokens.
