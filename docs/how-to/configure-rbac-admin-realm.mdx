## Introduction

In this guide you will learn how to create custom **Administrative Roles** and assign **users** and **groups** to those roles for your Beyond Identity Console.
This will allow you to have fine grained access control of your Beyond Identity Console users.

:::note
This guide only applies to the **Beyond Identity Admin** realm and the **Beyond Identity Admin Console** application. All actions should be performed in the **Beyond Identity Admin** realm. 
For a general guide on configuring Roles Based Access Control for your application, see our guide to **[Configure RBAC](/docs/configure-rbac)**.

## Administrative Roles

By default, there is a **Super Administrators** role that is a role capable of all Management API actions. This role allows any action performed in the Beyond Identity Console.

To create a new role, follow the steps to [Create a role](docs/create-role). Select all scopes that you would like that role to have and give it a proper name and description.

To add identities and groups to that role, follow the steps to [Add a user or group to a role](/docs/add-user-group-to-role). Those identities and groups should now have the
permissions granted to them.

:::note
For roles to kick into effect, your admins must logout and login again.
