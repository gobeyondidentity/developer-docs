## Prerequisites

- Set up a [developer account](./account-setup.md)

## How to

Any authentication starts with an /authorize request as dictated by [RFC-6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749). The best way to list all authentications is this:


- Filter by event type AUTHORIZE_REQUEST
- Find the event of interest
- Filter by the correlation ID of the chosen event
- Cancel the event type filter to see other events in the flow

## Event Types Reference

### PolicyEvaluation

Information about a policy evaluation.

### TransactionOperation

Event recorded when transactions are accessed.

The content of the transactions field depending on action is:

- if action == CREATE, the created objects.
- if action == READ, the objects returned by the operation.
- if action == UPDATE, the updated objects.
- if action == DELETE, the deleted objects.

### PgwTransactionOperation

Event recorded when PGW transactions are accessed.

The content of the transactions field depending on action is:

- if action == CREATE, the created objects.
- if action == READ, the objects returned by the operation.
- if action == UPDATE, the updated objects.
- if action == DELETE, the deleted objects.

### TokenOperation

Event recorded when tokens are accessed.

The content of the tokens field depending on action is:

- if action == CREATE, the created objects.
- if action == READ, the objects returned by the operation.
- if action == UPDATE, the updated objects.
- if action == DELETE, the deleted objects.

### GrantOperation

Event recorded when grants are accessed.

The content of the grants field depending on action is:

- if action == CREATE, the created objects.
- if action == READ, the objects returned by the operation.
- if action == UPDATE, the updated objects.
- if action == DELETE, the deleted objects.

### CredentialChange

Event recorded when a credential is bound to an identity or revoked.
AuthenticationTransaction

The Authentication Transaction event is recorded whenever the Beyond
Identity cloud touches an authentication transaction. This might happen
for a number of reasons, such as:

- Someone has initiated an authentication transaction by hitting an authorize endpoint
- Beyond Identity has suspended the authentication transaction to wait for more data
- Beyond Identity has resumed the authentication transaction to consume supplied data
- Beyond Identity has completed the authentication transaction

Usually, Authentication Transaction events occur in a chain that is
started by an Authorize Request event. 

#### Possible outcomes

The cause of the event being recorded can be determined using its outcome as follows:

- START: The authentication transaction has been started on the cloud. No authenticator interaction has happened so far.
- SUSPEND: The authentication transaction has been suspended on the cloud. This usually means that the cloud has issued a challenge for the authenticator.
- RESUME: The authentication transaction has been resumed on the cloud to consume an answer from the authenticator.
- COMPLETE:DENY: The authentication transaction has been completed and the end user has been denied access to the system.
- COMPLETE:ALLOW: The authentication transaction has been completed and the end user has been granted access to the system.
- ERROR: The authentication transaction couldn’t have been completed because an error has occurred. The end user has been denied access to the system.

#### Notes about actor

For this event type, the availability of the actor might is limited by
the authentication method used by the end user. In case the end user is
authenticating using a passkey, the actor is set to the identity that
owns the passkey.

### AuthorizeRequest

This event is recorded whenever the OAuth/OIDC /authorize endpoint is
hit for any application in this tenant & realm. The operation represented
by this event typically kicks off a chain of other operations that
together represent an authentication attempt to some application within
this tenant & realm. All of the operations representing the
authentication attempt share the same correlation ID as this event.

#### Possible outcomes

Before this event is recorded, Beyond Identity validates the request
using the rules from [RFC-6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).


If the request satisfies the rules, the outcome is set to ACCEPTED. 

If the request does not satisfy the rules, the outcome is set to ERROR. 
Notes about actor

This event does not carry any information about the end user’s identity
because it happens before Beyond Identity has a chance to determine who
the end user is. This event does not represent an operation that modifies
the system.

### TokenRequest

This event is recorded whenever the OAuth/OIDC token endpoint is hit for
some application in the tenant & realm. This event does not represent an
operation that modifies the system. Beyond Identity supports two major
OAuth grant types: client credentials and authorization code. 

In case authorization code grant is used, this event is usually the
last part of a full authentication chain together with Authorize Request,
Authentication Transaction and Grant Operation events. All of the events
that are part of a full authentication process share the same correlation
ID.

In case client_credentials grant is used, this event is usually the
last part of a smaller chain that doesn’t involve an authenticator.
Because of that, there are no Authorize Request or Authentication
Transaction events involved in the process. Event presence

It's important to remember that this event might not be present in the
chain in case the token endpoint is never called during the
authentication. If the token endpoint is never called, that just means
that the authentication hasn’t been finished.

#### Possible Outcomes

Before this event is recorded, Beyond Identity validates the request
using the rules from [RFC-6749#4.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.3) (in case of authorization code grant) or
[RFC-6749#4.4.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4.2) (in case of client credentials grant).

If the request satisfies the rules, the outcome field of this event is set to ACCEPTED.

If the request does not satisfy the rules, the outcome field of this event is set to ERROR.

##### ERROR outcome

The event contains an error field which might contain useful
information about why the attempted operation has failed.

#### Notes about actor

The token endpoint call is usually initiated by an application that the
end user is logging in to. However, the actor of this event answers the
question “who is the subject of the token?” instead of “who caused this
operation?”. The type of the actor depends on which grant type has been
used to call the token endpoint.

In case of client credentials, the actor is set to the application that
owns the client credentials used to authenticate the call.

In case of authorization code, the actor is set to the identity that has
completed the authentication process and obtained the one-time grant code
in previous steps of the flow.

### UserinfoRead

Event recorded when the userinfo endpoint is used.
