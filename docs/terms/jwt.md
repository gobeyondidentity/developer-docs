JSON web token (JWT), pronounced "jot", is an open industry standard [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) that defines a way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. All JWTs are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs. 

In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots. Each section (Header, Payload, Signature) is comprised of base64url-encoded JSON.
