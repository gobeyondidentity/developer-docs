The **bindPasskey** function enables your app to generate and bind a new passkey to an identity. The identity can be one that you create via the Beyond Identity [API](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Identities/operation/CreateIdentity) or one that exists already in the tenant you target.

_This is a reference article that describes the **bindPasskey** function. For a complete walk-through on creating a new passkey, see our guide [Bind Passkey to an identity](/docs/add-passkey)._

## Dependencies

The **bindPasskey** function requires the Beyond Identity SDK.

<InstallationAll />

## Prerequisites

Before making a call to **bindPasskey**, you must complete the following prerequisite calls:

1. Import the required types and functions from the SDK.

  <ImportAll />

2. Initialize the SDK.

  <InitializeAll />

3. Get a passkey binding link URL using the Beyond Identity [API](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Credential-Binding-Jobs).

  > _Generating a passkey binding link has several inputs and options. For details, see [passkey-binding-jobs](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Credential-Binding-Jobs)._

4. Use **isBindPasskeyUrl** to verify passkey binding link.

  <IsBindPasskeyUrl />

## Parameters

  <BindPasskeyUrlParametersAll />

## Returns

On success, the **bindPasskey** function returns a Promise that resolves to a **BindPasskeyResponse**, which itself is an object that contains the following keys:

- **passkey**: an object representing the newly created passkey. See example [passkey](/docs/embedded-reference-passkey-type).

- **postBindRedirect**: a string containing the URL to redirect to upon successfully binding a passkey. This is the URL that you specified in the earlier call to the [API](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/api/v1#tag/Credential-Binding-Jobs) to get the passkey binding link

## Notes

Call this function from client-side code, as it needs to run in either in the browser or natively on iOS/Android.

## Examples

### Example: Call **bindPasskey** after validating passkey binding URL

<IsBindPasskeyUrlExample />

### Example: Create an identity and get passkey binding URL

In this example, you'll first create a new identity using the API, then generate and retrieve the passkey binding URL.

To achieve this, we use several data elements:

1. Configuration from your BI tenant:

  | Property | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | **TENANT_ID** | The Tenant ID of the tenant in which the app is configured. |
  | **REALM_ID** | The Realm ID of the realm in which the app is configured. |
  | **AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIG_ID** | The Authenticator Config ID from the Authenticator Config tab of the app's configuration page. |

1. Other passkey binding API parameters:

  | Property | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | **delivery_method** | Select **RETURN** to deliver the URL directly in the response. |
  | **post\_binding\_redirect\_uri** | An optional parameter that specifies a URL the user gets redirected to _after_ a successful binding (see **Returns** above). |

3. The **identityId** returned from the first call is used for the second call.

4. A username passed into the function is used to create the user and establish their email name

You can find the resulting passkey binding URL in the **credential_binding_link** member of the response JSON returned from the second call.

    "realm_id": "cdf4862dc4d49791",

}
```

From the response above, you can see that the required binding URL is returned in the **credential_binding_link** member of the response JSON. This is the URL that you will pass into the **bindPasskey** function.

### Example: Get passkey binding URL for existing identity

To obtain a passkey binding URL for an existing identity, you will first need to retrieve the identity ID for a known user:

<MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl -X GET "https://${API_URL}/v1/tenants/${TENANT_ID}/realms/${REALM_ID}/identities?filter=username%20eq%20%22john%22" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"'
  title="Retrieve existing identity"
  />

Where the response JSON will look like:

```json
{
  "identities": [
    {
      "id": "e372db224c06e850",
      "realm_id": "8f5bec58229e6f29",
      "tenant_id": "0001f1f460b1ace6",
      "display_name": "Test Identity",
      "create_time": "2022-04-12T05:53:07.119Z",
      "update_time": "2022-06-16T14:31:03.770Z",
      "traits": {
        "type": "traits_v0",
        "username": "test",
        "primary_email_address": "test@example.com"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_size": 1
}
```

You can then use the identity ID to obtain the credential binding URL:

<MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl -X POST \
"${API_URL}/v1/tenants/${TENANT_ID}/realms/${REALM_ID}/identities/${IDENTITY_ID}/credential-binding-jobs" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "{
  "job": {
    "delivery_method": "RETURN",
    "authenticator_config_id": "${AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIG_ID}",
    "post_binding_redirect_uri": "http://example.com"
  }
}"
'
  title="Get Credential Binding Link for Identity"
  />

Where the response JSON will look like:

```json
{
  "credential_binding_job": {
    "id": "c4fc2d753ca22b14",
    "realm_id": "cdf4862dc4d49791",
    "tenant_id": "000183a77dd50fa9",
    "identity_id": "87fabad6956c6d4b",
    "delivery_method": "RETURN",
    "state": "LINK_SENT",
    "post_binding_redirect_uri": "http://example.com/callback",
    "authenticator_config_id": "67bb0acf12e5c899",
    "expire_time": "2022-03-21T03:42:52.905Z",
    "create_time": "2022-03-14T03:42:52.905Z",
    "update_time": "2022-03-15T05:55:23.823Z"
  },
  "credential_binding_link": "http://example.com/v1/tenants/000183a77dd50fa9/realms/cdf4862dc4d49791/identities/87fabad6956c6d4b/credential-binding-jobs/c4fc2d753ca22b14:invokeAuthenticator?token=1St9IKIIrYyQ8sOSeuk5UkbLKnBJhuD4I7nWIqt-BNANDEFS-XVuOHxB7TFdZcRm"
}
```

From the response above, you can see that the required binding URL is returned in the **credential_binding_link** member of the response JSON. This is the URL that you will pass into the **bindPasskey** function.

### Example: Get credential binding URL via email

The following example shows how to obtain a credential binding URL for a known identity ID via email.

<MultiLanguageCodeBlock
  curl='curl -X POST "${API_URL}/v1/tenants/${TENANT_ID}/realms/${REALM_ID}/identities/${IDENTITY_ID}/credential-binding-jobs" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "{
      "job": {
        "delivery_method": "${EMAIL}",
        "authenticator_config_id": "${AUTHENTICATOR_CONFIG_ID}",
        "post_binding_redirect_uri": "http://example.com"
      }
    }"
'
  title="Send Credential Binding Link for Identity Over Email"
  />

Where the response JSON will look like:

```json
{
  "credential_binding_job": {
    "id": "c4fc2d753ca22b14",
    "realm_id": "cdf4862dc4d49791",
    "tenant_id": "000183a77dd50fa9",
    "identity_id": "87fabad6956c6d4b",
    "delivery_method": "EMAIL",
    "state": "LINK_SENT",
    "post_binding_redirect_uri": "http://example.com/callback",
    "authenticator_config_id": "67bb0acf12e5c899",
    "expire_time": "2022-03-21T03:42:52.905Z",
    "create_time": "2022-03-14T03:42:52.905Z",
    "update_time": "2022-03-15T05:55:23.823Z"
  }
}
```

Notice how `"credential_binding_link"` is not in the response payload since it was sent over email.

When the user clicks the link in the Beyond Identity registration email, they will be redirected to your application's Invoke URL, as configured in the Authenticator Config tab in your BI tenant, with an automatically appended '/bind' route, for example, 'http://example.com/bind', with several query string parameters appended.

Your app must have a route or page to intercept this redirect, and send it to the **bindPasskey** function as follows:

<IsBindPasskeyUrlExample />
