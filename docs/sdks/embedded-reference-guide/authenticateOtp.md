The **authenticateOtp** function enables an app using the Beyond Identity Javascript SDK to initiate authentication using an OTP. The OTP gets sent to the provided email address. This function is used in conjunction with [redeemOtp](embedded-reference-redeemOtp).

## Dependencies

The **authenticateOtp** function requires the Beyond Identity Javascript SDK.

```bash
npm install @beyondidentity/bi-sdk-js
```

## Prerequisites

Before making a call to **authenticateOtp**, you must complete the following prerequisite calls:

1. Import the required types and functions from the SDK.

  ```javascript
  import { Embedded } from "@beyondidentity/bi-sdk-js";
  ```

2. Initialize the SDK.

  ```javascript
  const embedded = await Embedded.initialize();
  ```

3. Use **authenticateOtp** to initiate authentication using an OTP.

  ```javascript
  await embedded.authenticateOtp(url, email);
  ```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **url** | string | Required. The authentication URL of the current transaction. This URL is generated by the Beyond Identity API's `/authorize` endpoint in response to a standard OpenID Connect request from your app (see [example](#example:-retrieve-beyond-identity-authentication-url-via-oidc-call) below). The generated URL is unique for each authentication request. It contains an encoded JWT token containing the challenge for the passkey to sign. (`/bi-authenticate?request=someToken`) |
| **email** | string | Required. The email address where the OTP gets sent. |

## Returns

On success, the **authenticateOtp** function returns a Promise that resolves to an **OtpChallengeResponse**, which itself is a JSON object that contains the following keys:

**url**: object containing a URL containing the authentication state.

:::note
This URL should be saved and used when calling [redeemOtp](embedded-reference-redeemOtp).
:::

## Examples

### Example: Call **authenticateOtp**

```javascript
let authenticateResponse = await embedded.authenticateOtp(url, email);
```

### Example: Retrieve Beyond Identity authentication url via OIDC call

The app sends an OIDC call to the Beyond Identity API's `/authorize` endpoint:

```http
GET https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/{TENANT_ID}/realms/{REALM_ID}/applications/{APPLICATION_ID}/authorize?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&scope=openid&response_type=code&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&state=8LIY29kN8Oz7zrAhb8xb0yvem-gvnRy1HTn03MAuL_E
```

where the following elements match the corresponding properties of the app as configured in your Beyond Identity tenant:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **TENANT_ID** | The Tenant ID of the tenant in which the app is configured. |
| **REALM_ID** | The Realm ID of the realm in which the app is configured. |
| **APPLICATION_ID** | The Application ID from the header of the app's configuration page. |
| **CLIENT_ID** | The Client ID from the External Protocol tab of the app's configuration page. |
| **REDIRECT_URI** | Matches one of the Redirect URIs configured on the External Protocol tab of the app's configuration page, URL encoded. |

When the Invocation Type configured on the Authenticator Config tab of the app's configuration page is set to Manual, it returns a JSON object:

```json
{ "authenticate_url": "http://localhost:8083/bi-authenticate?request={BI_JWT}" }
```

where **BI_JWT** is a base64url encoded JWT token containing the challenge and other data to kick off the passkey authentication.

When the Invocation Type on the app is set to Automatic, it returns an HTTP 302 to the authentication URL:

```http
http/1.1 302 Found
...
location: http://localhost:8083/bi-authenticate?request={BI_JWT}
```

where **BI_JWT** is a base64url encoded JWT token containing the challenge and other data to kick off the passkey authentication.
