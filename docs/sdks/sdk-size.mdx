# SDK Size

This page explains what to expect in terms of size when you add Beyond Identity to your application.

---

We have heavily optimized the size of the SDK so that its impact on the total size of the app would be minimal. Below is the amount added to the final download and install size of an app on each platform.

The numbers below are accurate as of version 2.0.0 of the SDK.

| Platform | Download Size | Install Size |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Kotlin | 23.7 MB | 25.7 MB |
| Swift | ? MB | ? MB |

:::note Install Size vs Download Size
The Install Size was calculated by importing the SDK into an empty project. This number is larger than the Download Size because of other dependencies and may be much smaller depending on your app's dependencies.

:::info App Thinning on iOS
Because of App Thinning on iOS, the download size of the SDK varies slightly on different iOS devices.
