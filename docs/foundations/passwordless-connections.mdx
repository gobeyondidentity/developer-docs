Beyond Identity initiates passwordless authentication by returning an authentication challenge and other information to your app. 

Before authenticating, your app can use the Beyond Identity SDK to enumerate available passkesy and should perform some logic to select one, such as presenting selection UI to the user. Once a passkey is selected, you can then use the SDK to complete authentication and finally perform the OAuth code to token exchange. <mark>This entire paragraph is a "workflow" so a visual might be useful</mark>
