<p><mark>Do we call this topic "Authentication" or "Passwordless connections"? I don't even know if we need this topic. The idea was to have this topic as the "overview" of what passwordless connections are available but then have an entire topic dedicated to the nuts and bolts (like we have for Universal Passkeys).</mark></p>


Beyond Identity initiates passwordless authentication by returning an authentication challenge and other information to your app. Before authenticating, your app can use the Beyond Identity SDK to enumerate available passkesy and should perform some logic to select one, such as presenting selection UI to the user. Once a passkey is selected, you can then use the SDK to complete authentication and finally perform the OAuth code to token exchange. <mark>This entire paragraph is a "workflow" so a visual might be useful</mark>
