The Beyond Identity Console provides you with a UI for administering your tenant. 

The Console utilizes your **Beyond Identity Admin** Realm and Console application configuration to authenticate and authorize admin logins. In addition, an initial Policy gets created in the Beyond Identity Admin Realm on the deployment of your tenant. 

When the tenant gets deployed, the **Beyond Identity Admin Console** gets created as a managed object under **Beyond Identity Admin > Apps**. As a managed object, it is not editable through the Console.

You'll access the Admin Console at any time using your selected region:

```http
https://console-{REGION}.beyondidentity.com
```

The **Admin Console Access** User Group is created, and the identity established at sign-up is added. Adding users to the group will allow them to log into the Console as Administrators of your tenant utilizing any credentials established within the Admin Realm.

:::caution important
It's possible to lock yourself out of the Console with this policy and group control access.
