OTP (one-time password) is an auto generated code that is sent to the user's email address and can only be used once for a single login. This can be used to prove that the user has access to the email address associated with the account in question. OTP email verification is used on the Hosted Web Authenticator for sign-up and new browser logins and provided to you automatically when you configure your application's [Configuration Type](/docs/add-an-application#authenticator-config-tab) as `Hosted Web`.
