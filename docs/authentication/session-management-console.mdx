## Admin Console

In the Admin Console, there are a number of options for token configuration within your application.

Note: Refresh tokens can only be configured and enabled for applications with an "Authorization Code" grant type.

### Token Format

There are two token formats that can be validated: `self_contained` or `referential`.

The main distinguishing factor is whether introspection is optional or required. Self-contained tokens contain claims which can be used to validate the token. Referential tokens require an introspect call in order to retrieve the claims and validate the token.

When validating self-contained tokens, consider if you want to revoke your tokens. If revoked tokens are accepted (as in a MVP case), then the token can be validated [offline](/docs/validate-access-tokens#offline-validation) by validating the signature and parsing the claims of the JWT token. In all other cases the token should be [introspected](/docs/validate-access-tokens#introspection-endpoint).

### Token Configuration: Expires

This is the time, in seconds, for which the token will be considered valid after minting. The default value is `86400`, or 24 hours.

### Token Configuration: Subject

Property of a principal which is used to fill the subject of a token issued for this application. The default value is `id`. You may also choose to use `email` or `username`. In case of applications with client_credentials grant type, the only valid value is `id` because there is no `email` nor `username` available in an application.

### Token Configuration: Token Signing Algorithm

The Token Signing Algorithm is is the algorithm to used to sign a token. The only allowable value at present is `RS256`. RS256 algorithm is an asymmetric algorithm that uses a private key to sign a JWT and a public key to verify that signature.

### Refresh Token Configuration: Refresh Token Setting

The Refresh Token Setting allows you to enable refresh tokens. The default is `disabled`.

If enabled, when an access token is minted, a refresh token will also be minted. When an access token expires, the refresh token can be used to exchange for a new access token, via the `token` endpoint as described in [RFC-6749#6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-6).

If disabled, when an access token is minted, a refresh token will not be minted. When an access token expires, the user will need to authenticate, and a new access token can be minted.

### Refresh Token Configuration: Absolute Duration

The Absolute Duration is the total amount of time, in seconds, a refresh token is allowed to live before a user must re-authenticate. The default value is `0`, which means that the token expires immediately.

When a refresh token expires, the user will need to authenticate, and a new access token and refresh token pair can be minted.

### Refresh Token Configuration: Rotate

Rotate defines if the server should issue a new refresh token on each call to the refresh_token flow, or if the client could hold onto the old token. True if rotation should be enabled. The default is `disabled`.

If rotation is enabled, then the old refresh tokens are revoked each time a new refresh token is minted, and must be discarded.

If rotation is disabled, then a refresh tokens may continue to be used until it expires or is revoked.
