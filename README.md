# Developer Docs

This is the repository for Beyond Identity's [Developer Documentation](https://developer.beyondidentity.com/) site.

### What is Beyond Identity
---
Beyond Identity helps developers deploy the strongest authentication primitives on the planet, eliminating shared secrets for customers, employees, and contractors.

Unique to Beyond Identity, shared secrets are eliminated for sign-up, login, and recovery. For customers, they never have to type a password, enter a code, click a push notification, or pick up a second device at all for authentication across all devices.

In addition to the fact that authentication is multi-factor by default, Beyond Identity also delivers real-time user and device risk signals that you can leverage to implement risk-based access controls that prompt for step-up authentication in scenarios you deem to be higher risk.

Backed by a cloud-native architecture, our platform was built for enterprise workloads. All SDKs use industry-standard protocols (OIDC/OAuth2.0) and include a sample app.

### Why does Beyond Identity exist?
---
We believe public private key pairs are fundamentally, a better way to authenticate users (and machines!).

In order to fully address challenges of customer authentication, any solution must be:

- Secure: multi-factor with zero reliance on shared secrets or phishable factors
- Easy to use: frictionless with no need for second devices or complicated steps
- Universal across applications and devices: consistent experience across native and web apps on any device
- Simple for developers to integrate: to reduce engineering workload so developers can work on their core product instead of authentication

The only solution that met the above requirements was an authentication framework built off of public-private key pairs.

While we’re not the first to solve the problem with asymmetric cryptography, the existing solutions today fall short given the lack of cross-platform interoperability, and the friction presented to users.

### Installation
