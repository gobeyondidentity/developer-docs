A Universal Passkey is a public and private key pair. The private key is generated and stored and never leaves the user’s device. The public key, on the other hand, is sent to the Beyond Identity cloud. 

All keys get linked to the user and their devices cryptographically. The keys are compatible with any OS device and can be managed using our APIs.
