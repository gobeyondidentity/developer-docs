    # Introduction

    The Beyond Identity API defines methods for managing realms, directories,
    credentials, and applications.

    All of the functionality available in the Beyond Identity Admin Console is
    also available through the API.

    This API is currently in the early-access stage and is under active
    development. Feedback and suggestions are encouraged and should be directed
    to the
    [Beyond Identity Developer Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/byndid/shared_invite/zt-1anns8n83-NQX4JvW7coi9dksADxgeBQ).

    # Authentication

    All Beyond Identity API endpoints require authentication using an access
    token. The access token is generated through OAuth 2.0 or OIDC, using the
    authorization code flow or the client credentials flow. The simplest way to
    acquire an access token is through the Beyond Identity Admin Console. Under
    the "Applications" tab, select the "Beyond Identity Management API"
    application, navigate to the "API Tokens" tab, and then click on
    "Create token".

    Alternatively, an access token may also be generated directly via the API by
    requesting a token for the "Beyond Identity Management API" Application.

    ```
    curl https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/applications/$APPLICATION_ID/token \
      -X POST \
      -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" --basic \
      -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
      -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=$SCOPES"
    ```

    This will work for any application that you have configured to provide
    access to the Beyond Identity Management API Resource Server. The "Beyond
    Identity Management API" application is provided by default as part of the
    tenant onboarding process.

    The access token must be provided in the `Authorization` header of the
    API request.

    ```
    curl https://api-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/... \
      -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
    ```

    ## Requests and Responses

    To interact with the Beyond Identity API, all requests should be made over
    HTTPS.

    The Beyond Identity API is generally structured as a resource-oriented API.
    Resources are represented as JSON objects and are used as both inputs to
    and outputs from API methods.

    Resource fields may be described as read-only and immutable. A read-only
    field is only provided on the response. An immutable field is only assigned
    once and may not be changed after. For example, system-generated IDs are
    described as both read-only and immutable.

    To create a new resource, requests should use the `POST` method. Create
    requests include all of the necessary attributes to create a new resource.
    Create operations return the created resource in the response.

    To retrieve a single resource or a collection of resources, requests should
    use the `GET` method. When retrieving a collection of resources, the
    response will include an array of JSON objects keyed on the plural name of
    the requested resource.

    To update an resource, requests should use the `PATCH` method. Update
    operations support partial updating so requests may specify only the
    attributes which should be updated. Update operations return the updated
    resource in the response.

    To delete a resource, requests should use the `DELETE` method. Note that
    delete operations return an empty response instead of returning the
    resource in the response.

    ### Example Response for a Realm

    ```
    {
      "id": "a448fe493e02fa9f",
      "tenant_id": "000168dc50bdce49",
      "display_name": "Test Realm",
      "create_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
      "update_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z"
    }
    ```

    ### Example Response for a Collection of Realms

    ```
    {
      "realms": [
        {
          "id": "a448fe493e02fa9f",
          "tenant_id": "000168dc50bdce49",
          "display_name": "Test Realm",
          "create_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
          "update_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z"
        }
      ],
      "total_size": 1
    }
    ```

    ## HTTP Statuses

    The API returns standard HTTP statuses and error codes.

    Statuses in the 200 range indicate that the request was successfully
    fulfilled and there were no errors.

    Statuses in the 400 range indicate that there was an issue with the request
    that may be addressed by the client. For example, client errors may
    indicate that the request was missing proper authorization or that the
    request was malformed.

    Statuses in the 500 range indicate that the server encountered an internal
    issue and was unable to fulfill the request.

    All error responses include a JSON object with a `code` field and a
    `message` field. `code` contains a human-readable name for the HTTP status
    code and `message` contains a high-level description of the error. The
    error object may also contain additional error details which may be used by
    the client to determine the exact cause of the error. Refer to each API
    method's examples to determine the specific error detail types supported
    for that method.

    ### Invalid Access Token Example

    If the provided access token is invalid, you will receive a 401 error.
    This error indicates that the token is not recognized and was not generated
    by Beyond Identity.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    {
      "code": "unauthorized",
      "message": "unauthorized"
    }
    ```

    ### Permission Denied Example

    If the provided access token does not have access to the requested resource,
    you will receive a 403 error. Access tokens are scoped at a minimum to your
    tenant. Any request for resources outside of your tenant will result in this
    error.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    {
      "code": "forbidden",
      "message": "forbidden"
    }
    ```

    ### Missing Resource Example

    If the requested resource does not exist, you will receive a 404 error. The
    specific API method may return additional details about the missing
    resource.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    {
      "code": "not_found",
      "message": "group not found"
      "details": [
        {
          "type": "ResourceInfo",
          "resource_type": "Group",
          "id": "4822738be6b7f658",
          "description": "group not found"
        }
      ],
    }
    ```

    ### Invalid Parameters Example

    If the request body contains invalid parameters, you will receive a 400
    error. The specific API method may return additional details about the
    invalid parameter.

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    {
      "code": "bad_request",
      "message": "invalid parameters"
      "details": [
        {
          "type": "FieldViolations"
          "field_violations": [
            {
              "description": "missing",
              "field": "group.display_name"
            }
          ],
        }
      ],
    }
    ```

        To list all realms for a tenant, send a GET request to
        `/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms`.

        The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 20 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of realms in the
        response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject to
        change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

            The response will be a JSON object with a key called `realms` and `total_size`. `realms` will be set to an array of realm objects, each of which contain the standard realm attributes. `total_size` will be set to the total number of items matched by the list request. If there are more items to be returned by the requested query, the response will also contain a key called `next_page_token`.

      description: |
        To list all groups for a realm, send a GET request to
        `/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/groups`.

        The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will contain 20 items.
        There is no defined ordering of the list of groups in the response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject to change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

      summary: List All Members for a Group
      description: |
        To list members belonging to a group, send a GET request to
        `/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/groups/$GROUP_ID:listMembers`.

        The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 20 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of members in the
        response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject to
        change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

If there are more items to be returned by the requested query, the response will also contain a key called `next_page_token`.

      description: |
        To list all identities for a realm, send a GET request to
        `/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/identities`.

        The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 20 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of identities in
        the response.  Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject to
        change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

        To list the groups to which an identity belongs, send a GET request to

        The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 20 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of groups in the
        response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject to
        change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

      description: |
        To list all credential binding jobs for an identity, send a GET request to
        `/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/identities/$IDENTITY_ID/credential-binding-jobs`.
        `$IDENTITY_ID` may be a wildcard (`-`) to request all credential binding
        jobs across all identities within the realm.

        The response will contain at most 200 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 20 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of credential
        binding jobs in the response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes
        are subject to change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

      description: |
        To list all applications for a realm, send a GET request to
        `/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/applications`.

        The response will contain at most 100 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 100 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of applications
        in the response.  Note that the maximum and default page sizes are subject
        to change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

        The response will contain at most 100 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 100 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of authenticator
        configurations in the response. Note that the maximum and default page sizes
        are subject to change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

        The response will contain at most 100 items and may contain a page token to
        query the remaining items. If page size is not specified, the response will
        contain 100 items. There is no defined ordering of the list of resource
        servers in the response.  Note that the maximum and default page sizes are
        subject to change.

        When paginating, the page size is maintained by the page token but may be
        overridden on subsequent requests. The skip is not maintained by the page
        token and must be specified on each subsequent request.

        Page tokens expire after one week. Requests which specify an expired page
        token will result in undefined behavior.

        values are:
        - `confidential`: Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality
          of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with
          restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure
          client authentication using other means.
        - `public`: Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their
          credentials (e.g., clients executing on the device used by the
          resource owner, such as an installed native application or a web

          endpoint.
        - `client_credentials`: The client credentials grant type defined

            the `pkce` field is left blank. Please note that public OIDC and OAuth2 configured
            applications MUST enable PKCE support. Confidential clients can leave PKCE disabled 
            if they choose. 
          - `plain` : PKCE is enabled for this application. The server will correlate the `code_challenge` and 
            `code_verifier` between the `authorize` and `token` requests. In this configuration, those fields are
            required to be identical. This is the lower security option for PKCE support and should only be used
            by legacy clients, or clients that don't support `s256`. 
          - `s256` : PKCE is enabled for this application, and the server will correlate the `code_challenge` and
            `code_verifier` between the `authorize` and `token` requests. In this configuration, those fields are
            required to equate as follows: `code_challenge` = `base64url(sha256(ascii(code_verifier)))`. This is
            the higher security option and should always be preferred if it is supported by the client.
