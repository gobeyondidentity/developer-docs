    # Introduction

    **NOTE:** To determine if you are accessing the Secure Access Platform, check the URL of your Admin Console.
    If it looks like one of the following, you are using the Secure Access Platform:
    - `https://console.beyondidentity.com` (Localized to your region)
    - `https://console-us.beyondidentity.com` (US region)
    - `https://console-eu.beyondidentity.com` (EU region)
    - `https://console.us1.beyondidentity-gov.com` (US FedRAMP)

    If your Admin Console URL does not look like one of the above, you are using the Secure Workforce Platform. Please refer to the [Secure Workforce API documentation](https://docs.beyondidentity.com/api/v0). <br /><br />

    The Beyond Identity Secure Access API defines methods for managing resources in the Beyond Identity Secure Access platform.<br /><br />

    All of the functionality available in the Beyond Identity Admin Console is
    also available through the API. <br /><br />

    This API is currently in the early-access stage and is under active
    development. Feedback and suggestions are encouraged and should be directed
    to the
    [Beyond Identity Developer Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/byndid/shared_invite/zt-1anns8n83-NQX4JvW7coi9dksADxgeBQ).

    # Base API URLs

    The base API URLs is determined by the region your tenant is hosted in OR if you are a FedRAMP customer. <br><br>

    ### US Region

    If you are a US region customer, your base API URLs will be:
    - `https://api-us.beyondidentity.com`
    - `https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com`

    ### EU Region

    If you are a EU region customer, your base API URLs will be:
    - `https://api-eu.beyondidentity.com`
    - `https://auth-eu.beyondidentity.com`

    ### US FedRAMP

    **NOTE**: The FedRAMP version of Secure Access is released approximately *two weeks* after the commercial version, so some API endpoints may not be available immediately. <br><br>

    If you are a FedRAMP customer in the US region, your base API URLs will be:
    - `https://api.us1.beyondidentity-gov.com`
    - `https://auth.us1.beyondidentity-gov.com`

    For all the examples in this document, we will use the US region API base URL. You can always replace `https://api-us.beyondidentity.com`
    and `https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com` in the examples to use the proper base URL for your tenant.

    # Authentication

    All Beyond Identity API endpoints require authentication using an access
    token. The access token is generated through OAuth 2.0 or OIDC, using the
    authorization code flow or the client credentials flow. <br /><br />

    The simplest way to acquire an access token is through the Beyond Identity Admin Console. Under the "Applications" tab, select the "Beyond Identity Management API" application, navigate to the "API Tokens" tab, and then click on "Create token". <br /><br />

    Alternatively, an access token may also be generated directly via the API by
    requesting a token for the "Beyond Identity Management API" Application. <br><br>

    ```
    curl https://auth-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/tenants/$TENANT_ID/realms/$REALM_ID/applications/$APPLICATION_ID/token \
      -X POST \
      -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" --basic \
      -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
      -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=$SCOPES"
    ```

    This will work for any application that you have configured to provide
    access to the Beyond Identity Management API Resource Server. The "Beyond
    Identity Management API" application is provided by default as part of the
    tenant onboarding process.

    The access token must be provided in the `Authorization` header of the
    API request. <br><br>

    ```
    curl https://api-us.beyondidentity.com/v1/... \
      -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
    ```

    ## Requests and Responses

    To interact with the Beyond Identity API, all requests should be made over
    HTTPS. <br /><br />

    The Beyond Identity API is generally structured as a resource-oriented API.
    Resources are represented as JSON objects and are used as both inputs to
    and outputs from API methods. <br /><br />

    Resource fields may be described as read-only and immutable. A read-only
    field is only provided on the response. An immutable field is only assigned
    once and may not be changed after. For example, system-generated IDs are
    described as both read-only and immutable. <br /><br />

    To create a new resource, requests should use the `POST` method. Create
    requests include all of the necessary attributes to create a new resource.
    Create operations return the created resource in the response. <br /><br />

    To retrieve a single resource or a collection of resources, requests should
    use the `GET` method. When retrieving a collection of resources, the
    response will include an array of JSON objects keyed on the plural name of
    the requested resource. <br /><br />

    To update an resource, requests should use the `PATCH` method. Update
    operations support partial updating so requests may specify only the
    attributes which should be updated. Update operations return the updated
    resource in the response. <br /><br />

    To delete a resource, requests should use the `DELETE` method. Note that
    delete operations return an empty response instead of returning the
    resource in the response. <br /><br />

    ### Example Response for a Realm

    ```
    {
      "id": "a448fe493e02fa9f",
      "tenant_id": "000168dc50bdce49",
      "display_name": "Test Realm",
      "create_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
      "update_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z"
    }
    ```

    ### Example Response for a Collection of Realms

    ```
    {
      "realms": [
        {
          "id": "a448fe493e02fa9f",
          "tenant_id": "000168dc50bdce49",
          "display_name": "Test Realm",
          "create_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z",
          "update_time": "2022-06-22T21:46:08.930278Z"
        }
      ],
      "total_size": 1
    }
    ```

    ## HTTP Statuses

    The API returns standard HTTP statuses and error codes.

    Statuses in the 200 range indicate that the request was successfully
    fulfilled and there were no errors. <br><br>

    Statuses in the 400 range indicate that there was an issue with the request
    that may be addressed by the client. For example, client errors may
    indicate that the request was missing proper authorization or that the
    request was malformed. <br><br>

    Statuses in the 500 range indicate that the server encountered an internal
    issue and was unable to fulfill the request. <br><br>

    All error responses include a JSON object with a `code` field and a
    `message` field. `code` contains a human-readable name for the HTTP status
    code and `message` contains a high-level description of the error. The
    error object may also contain additional error details which may be used by
    the client to determine the exact cause of the error. Refer to each API
    method's examples to determine the specific error detail types supported
    for that method. <br><br>

    ### Invalid Access Token Example

    If the provided access token is invalid, you will receive a 401 error.
    This error indicates that the token is not recognized and was not generated
    by Beyond Identity. <br><br>

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    {
      "code": "unauthorized",
      "message": "unauthorized"
    }
    ```

    ### Permission Denied Example

    If the provided access token does not have access to the requested resource,
    you will receive a 403 error. Access tokens are scoped at a minimum to your
    tenant. Any request for resources outside of your tenant will result in this
    error. <br><br>

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    {
      "code": "forbidden",
      "message": "forbidden"
    }
    ```

    ### Missing Resource Example

    If the requested resource does not exist, you will receive a 404 error. The
    specific API method may return additional details about the missing
    resource. <br><br>

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    {
      "code": "not_found",
      "message": "group not found"
      "details": [
        {
          "type": "ResourceInfo",
          "resource_type": "Group",
          "id": "4822738be6b7f658",
          "description": "group not found"
        }
      ],
    }
    ```

    ### Invalid Parameters Example

    If the request body contains invalid parameters, you will receive a 400
    error. The specific API method may return additional details about the
    invalid parameter. <br><br>

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    {
      "code": "bad_request",
      "message": "invalid parameters"
      "details": [
        {
          "type": "FieldViolations"
          "field_violations": [
            {
              "description": "missing",
              "field": "group.display_name"
            }
          ],
        }
      ],
    }
    ```

      An SSO configuration defines how end users interact with supported SSO
      protocols and related services. Each configuration type represents a
      protocol or integration (e.g., SAML, WS-Federation, OIDC, SCIM) supported
      by Beyond Identity. An SSO configuration provides a flexible framework for
      managing authentication, provisioning, and other integrations. It
      abstracts application protocols, inbound and outbound provisioning, and
      supports named integrations. Additionally, it includes features like user
      or group assignments, visual tiles in the SSO interface, and compatibility
      with multiple authentication and provisioning standards.  This makes SSO
      configurations versatile for both authentication and non-authentication
      use cases.
