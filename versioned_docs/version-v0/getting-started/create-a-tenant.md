title: 1. Create a tenant
---
Beyond Identity account creation will be a manual process during this early phase.

You can complete this form to [request a tenant](https://forms.gle/3BvBsthE8ga4ohSd7).

A team member will contact you shortly to provide access to the tenant and answer any questions you may have.

You will be provided with the following items:
* Tenant Name
* API Token
* Admin Console URL

Once your account has been created with Beyond Identity, you can continue to configure your account.
