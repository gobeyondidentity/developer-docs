A Credential can be described as a public/private key pair where the private key is stored securely in a [TEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment). 

On macOS/iOS, this would be the [Secure Enclave](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web). 
When a user sets up an account with Beyond Identity, the device in which they register creates a Credential that becomes their identity. 
This private key associated with this Credential can never be removed from the device in question. It is however possible to extend the Credentialâ€™s chain of trust by creating a new Credential on a different device and signing it with the private key of the first Credential.
